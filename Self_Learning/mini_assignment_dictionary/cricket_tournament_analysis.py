#  Cricket Tournament Analytics System
# Problem Statement
# Store statistics of at least 30 cricket players.
# Example Structure
# players = {
# "Virat": {
# "runs": 645,
# "matches": 12,
# "wickets": 0
# }
# }
# Requirements
# 1. Display all player statistics.
# 2. Find highest run scorer.
# 3. Find lowest run scorer.
# 4. Calculate average runs.
# 5. Find player with maximum wickets.
# 6. Find all-rounders (runs > 300 and wickets > 5).
# 7. Display players scoring above average.
# 8. Create categories:
# o Star Performer
# o Good Performer
# o Average Performer
# o Poor Performer
# 9. Generate team statistics.
# 10. Display top 5 batsmen.
# 11. Display top 5 bowlers.
# 12. Create a separate dictionary for award winners.
