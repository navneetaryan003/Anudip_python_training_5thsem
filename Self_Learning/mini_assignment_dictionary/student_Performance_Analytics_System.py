# Student Performance Analytics System
# Problem Statement
# A coaching institute wants to analyze student performance.
# Store details of at least 30 students in a dictionary.
# Example Structure
# students = {
# "S101": {"name": "Anuj", "marks": 85},
# "S102": {"name": "Rahul", "marks": 72}
# }
# Requirements
# 1. Display all student records.
# 2. Search a student using Student ID.
# 3. Add a new student.
# 4. Update marks of an existing student.
# 5. Delete a student.
# 6. Find topper and lowest scorer.
# 7. Calculate class average.
# 8. Count pass and fail students.
# 9. Generate grades:
# o A (90+)
# o B (75–89)
# o C (50–74)
# o F (<50)
# 10. Display students scoring above average.
# 11. Display top 5 performers.
# 12. Create a separate dictionary for scholarship students (marks > 85).
